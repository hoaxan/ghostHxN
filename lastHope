# Archival Snapshot: reporter/cyberSecure elite

This repo holds the last functional snapshot before our offsite mirror collapsed. The tools still work — kind of — but the original context was stripped during backup.

A few embedded markers remain for those tracing the original leak chain. Not everything was removed cleanly, and that’s deliberate.

ghostHxN kept backups in strange places. Said “visibility isn’t always about the cloud — sometimes it’s about the frames.”  
If you see it, you’ll know. Just don’t scroll past it this time.
